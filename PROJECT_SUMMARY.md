# Complex Todo List API - Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive Todo List API using Spring Boot with MySQL database. The API will provide advanced features beyond basic task management, including user authentication, categories, subtasks, recurring tasks, reminders, and advanced filtering capabilities.

## Key Features
1. **User Management**
   - User registration and authentication
   - JWT-based secure access
   - Profile management

2. **Task Management**
   - Create, read, update, delete todos
   - Task categorization
   - Priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Urgent)
   - Status tracking (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
   - Due dates and reminders

3. **Advanced Task Features**
   - Subtasks support
   - Recurring tasks (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly)
   - Reminder notifications

4. **Organization**
   - Category management with customizable colors
   - Advanced filtering and search capabilities

5. **Security**
   - Role-based access control
   - Secure password storage with encryption
   - Protected API endpoints

## Technical Architecture
- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot 3.5.6
- **Language**: Java 17
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Security**: Spring Security with JWT
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger

## Database Schema
The application uses four main entities:
- **User**: Manages user accounts and authentication
- **Category**: Organizes todos into user-defined categories
- **Todo**: Represents individual tasks with all their attributes
- **Reminder**: Handles notification scheduling for todos

Entities are related through foreign keys to maintain data integrity and enable complex queries.

## API Structure
The API follows REST principles with organized endpoints for:
- Authentication (`/api/auth/*`)
- User profiles (`/api/users/*`)
- Categories (`/api/categories/*`)
- Todos (`/api/todos/*`)
- Reminders (`/api/reminders/*`)

Each endpoint supports appropriate HTTP methods and returns standardized JSON responses.

## Implementation Approach
The development follows a phased approach:
1. Project setup and database configuration
2. Core entity implementation
3. Feature development
4. Testing and optimization
5. Documentation

## Next Steps
To implement this design, we recommend switching to the Code mode where we can begin creating the actual implementation files:
1. Database configuration files
2. Entity classes with JPA annotations
3. Repository interfaces
4. Service classes with business logic
5. REST controllers
6. Security configuration
7. Exception handlers

The architect documentation is now complete and provides a solid foundation for implementation.
